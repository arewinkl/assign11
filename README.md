## Description
For this homework assignment we were tasked with developing the necessary __routes__ for the *note taker application* to run properly. The front end of the application is already provided to us, so the challenge is developing the back end. For this note taker application to work perfectly, you need to be able to grab information from existing files and post it in the note taker application. secondly the app needs to be able to take in *new info* and post it to the existing files. Once all of the back end components are working it needs to be posted to both __gitHub and Hiroku__. Styling of the page was required as well, so a css page would need to be attached along with the newly edited file.

## Installation

In order to get this __Note Taker__ to work, the first task was to download and install all of the necessary programming information. This meant loading all of the necessary __npm__ and __node.js__ add ons. This was extremely easy especially since we have continued to practiced this several times during class this week. Each of the packages installed in very little time and with the addition of the __.gitignore__ file, everything was ready for this assignment.

## challenges
I will say that just like every assignment that we have tackled in this class, this one was slightly harder then the last one that we did and provided some unique challenges. The first challenge was that we needed make sure that we were __requiring__ in all of the necessary elements for the package to run properly. This wasn't the biggest challenge in the world but it did require going back through several of the practice problems that we did this week to understand exactly why we were (requiring) them in and if we would be using all of the same ones in this assignment or if there would be some addition ones that would need to be added. Working from a single page simplified things, because it allowed me to require everything on a single page instead of doing it over again on every page, like if I had separated out the HTML and API javascript routes. The second major challenge that the Note Taker assignment delivered was writing all the necessary routes for the HTML and API, since this was our first week working with them it took some time to get familiar with writing them *especially ensuring that they had the correct route*. Overall the challenges with this assignment were no different than I have experienced so far in this class, they just took some extra time to figure out, and might also mean that you need to do some research to figure out why it needs to be written that way.
