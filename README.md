## Description
For this homework assignment we were tasked with developing the necessary __routes__ for the *note taker application* to run properly. The front end of the application is already provided to us, so the challenge is developing the back end. For this note taker application to work perfectly, you need to be able to grab information from existing files and post it in the note taker application. secondly the app needs to be able to take in *new info* and post it to the existing files. Once all of the back end components are working it needs to be posted to both __gitHub and Hiroku__. Styling of the page was required as well, so a css page would need to be attached along with the newly edited file.

## Installation

In order to get this __Note Taker__ to work, the first task was to download and install all of the necessary programming information. This meant loading all of the necessary __npm__ and __node.js__ add ons. This was extremely easy especially since we went over ane practiced thus several times during class this week. Each of the packages installed in very little time and with the addition of the __.gitignore__ file, everything was ready for this assignment.
